; Enable exploit fixes - automatically reapplies any missing/failed/incorrect
; patches that should have been set by the exploit. This helps maintain system
; stability after jailbreaking by ensuring the kernel is consistently patched
; across different exploits and firmware versions.
; Values: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
; Default: 1
exploit_fixes = 1

; Enable memory mapping patches for decrypting binary files. These patches
; allow the system to properly handle encrypted executables and libraries.
; Values: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
; Default: 1
mmap_patches = 1

; Block console firmware updates by unmounting the `/update` partition.
; This prevents accidental firmware updates that could patch the exploits.
; Values: 0 = allow updates, 1 = block updates
; Default: 1
block_updates = 1

; Disable userland ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
; ASLR randomizes memory addresses to prevent exploitation. Disabling it
; can improve compatibility with homebrew applications, debuggers, and cheats.
; Values: 0 = keep ASLR enabled, 1 = disable ASLR
; Default: 1

; NoBD (No Blu-ray Drive) patches - allows system updates without a working
; Blu-ray drive.
; Values: 0 = skip NoBD patches, 1 = apply NoBD patches
; Default: 0

; Target ID spoofer - changes the console's reported Target ID for development
; or region-specific functionality.

; Valid Target IDs:
;   0x80 = Diagnostic
;   0x81 = Devkit
;   0x82 = Testkit
;   0x83 = Japan
;   0x84 = USA
;   0x85 = Europe

;   0xA0 = Kratos (Arcade Cabinet)
;
; Values: 0 = no spoofing, or valid hex Target ID (e.g., 0x84)
; Default: 0

; Skip applying SceShellCore, SceShellUI, and RemotePlay patches
; Useful for testkit users
; Values: 0 = apply patches, 1 = skip patches
; Default: 0

; Write the default HEN plugin PRX files to the console's hard drive.
; This option controls whether the built-in HEN plugin files (PRX modules) are
; automatically written to the system's internal storage during initialization.
; Enabling this is recommended for first-time setup.
; Values: 0 = don't write plugins, 1 = write plugins to HDD
; Default: 0
upload_prx = 1

; Enable HEN plugin file loading and execution system
; This feature activates the plugin subsystem that allows loading of additional
; PRX modules to extend HEN's capabilities. Plugins can provide homebrew support,
; game patching, system modifications, and other advanced features. When enabled,
; HEN will scan for and load compatible plugin files from the system storage.
; Values: 0 = do not enable plugins, 1 = enable plugins
; Default: 0
